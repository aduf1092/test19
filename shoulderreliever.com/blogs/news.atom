<span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Hello friends and golfers! My name is </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://ejsgolf.com/about" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-href="https://ejsgolf.com/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Erik Schjolberg</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">, though most people call me Coach Erik. I’ve been teaching golf for over 25 years at my academy, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://ejsgolf.com" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-href="https://ejsgolf.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">EJS Golf</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">, located at McCormick Ranch G. C. in Scottsdale, AZ. </span>
</h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been fortunate to follow my dream and passion of coaching PGA Tour professionals, advanced juniors, college golfers, and countless others golfers. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">But let me take you back a bit. This is a story of pain, desperation, late-night infomercials, and, ultimately, a comeback that even I could hardly believe.</span></h3>
<h1 style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><b data-mce-fragment="1">The Painful Plunge</b></h1>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Let's rewind to about a year or so ago. At this point in my life I was coaching golf and swinging a golf club with no problems at all.  </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">hen, out of the blue, my life changed immensely which is always hard to handle when we don’t get to  dictate the outcome, life did.  </span>
</h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">So, playing golf one day <strong>I started experiencing excruciating shoulder pain</strong>. My right shoulder, which had already endured two rotator cuff surgeries, decided it was time for another round of misery. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">My supraspinatus muscle was completely torn, and there was no hope for a simple fix.</span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">My golf game became non existent as well as me performing drills and shots for my students at my teaching studio.   </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">My range of motion became limited.  So, when I would try to play golf or just hit some shots, I had absolutely no club head speed.   </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Going from driving the golf ball around 280 yards to hoping to hit it 200 yards is where I was at.  I tried to just hit irons for a while and then that was eventually stripped from me as well b/c of the pain.   </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Every aspect of my game was affected. But it wasn't just about golf. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Everyday activities became a chore. Brushing my teeth, lifting a coffee mug, even waving goodbye—each movement was a reminder of my physical limitations.</span></h3>
<h1 style="text-align: center;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Desperation in the Dark</b></h1>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">After consulting with a pain management doctor and an orthopedic surgeon, the verdict was in: I needed a complete shoulder reversal surgery. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The same shoulder that had already been through two surgeries was now a candidate for the only surgical option left and that was the full reverse shoulder replacement surgery.   </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Having had so much stripped from me in my life due to surgeries, I felt pretty low with this inevitable surgery on the horizon.    </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of such a major surgery was daunting. It would mean 3 months in a sling, a full year of recovery with no guarantees of range of motion.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">I had no idea if I would be able to golf again and be the golf coach that I was.    </span>
</h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">I need to be able to swing a golf club for my job and the thought of not being able to was scary.  </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Despite my reservations, I turned to physical therapy and chiropractors.  </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">I even paid thousands of dollars for the latest injections that were supposed to provide healing of some sort where other options didn’t.   </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">While these treatments provided some relief, they were expensive and the pain persisted. I was stuck in a painful loop, with no clear way out.</span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Then, one fateful night, as I sat hunched over my computer, I stumbled upon an ad for something called the Shoulder Reliever. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I’m not one to fall for late-night infomercials. In fact, I pride myself on being skeptical of anything that promises a quick fix. But I was desperate and I did give into my desperation knowing that there was a no question about a 60 day money back guarantee.   </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">I was willing to try anything to avoid another surgery. So, I did something I’d never done before: I clicked "buy" on an infomercial product.</span></h3>
<h1 style="text-align: center;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><b data-mce-fragment="1">The Skeptic's Gamble</b></h1>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Shoulder Reliever arrived at my doorstep a few days later. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">It was a simple device, with an instructional guide and a promise of relief. I couldn’t help but not fully believe this would work.  I mean, come on. But I was desperate, and I had nothing to lose. I started using the Shoulder Reliever religiously. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Every day, I spent 5-10 minutes working with it. The exercises were straightforward and didn’t feel like they were doing much at first. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">But I stuck with it, clinging to a sliver of hope.</span></h3>
<h1 style="text-align: center;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><b data-mce-fragment="1">The Unexpected Turnaround</b></h1>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">About three weeks into my routine with the Shoulder Reliever, something incredible happened. I started to notice a reduction in pain. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">My range of motion began to improve. I felt stronger, more stable. By the fourth week, I did the unthinkable: I picked up a golf club. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">With a mix of fear and excitement, I swung. It wasn’t perfect, but it was pain-free.</span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">I kept at it, day after day. The tiny muscles around my shoulder were getting stronger, providing the support that my damaged rotator cuff couldn’t. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The improvement was remarkable. I was shocked and as excited as anyone could be.  </span></h3>
<br data-mce-fragment="1">
<h1 style="text-align: center;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><b data-mce-fragment="1">My Doctor's Astonishment</b></h1>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">My next appointment with the surgeon was one for the books. He examined my shoulder and couldn’t believe the progress I had made. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The torn supraspinatus was still there, but the strengthening of the surrounding muscles had made a world of difference. He was amazed and, frankly, so was I.</span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Shoulder Reliever had done what months of physical therapy and chiropractic adjustments couldn’t. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>It gave me back my swing, my game, and a huge part of my life.</strong></h3>
<br data-mce-fragment="1">
<h1 style="text-align: center;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><b data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #00aaff;"><a title="Shoulder Reliever Product Page" href="https://shoulderreliever.com/products/shoulderreliever" style="color: #00aaff; text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-href="https://shoulderreliever.com/products/shoulderreliever">Shoulder Reliever</a></span>: The Game Changer</b></h1>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">So, what exactly is the <a title="Shoulder Reliever Product page" href="https://shoulderreliever.com/products/shoulderreliever" data-mce-href="https://shoulderreliever.com/products/shoulderreliever">Shoulder Reliever</a>, and why did it work so well? </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Shoulder Reliever is designed to target and strengthen the smaller, often neglected muscles around the shoulder joint. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">These muscles play a crucial role in stabilizing the shoulder, especially when the major muscles are compromised. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The device provides both daytime and nighttime support, ensuring that your shoulder is constantly being cared for.’</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Daytime Support</b></span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">During the day, the Shoulder Reliever offers exercises that are easy to incorporate into your routine. Here are the four exercises I found most beneficial:</span></h3>
<ul data-mce-fragment="1">
<li style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b data-mce-fragment="1">Rotational Lifts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">: This exercise focuses on improving the rotational strength of your shoulder. It’s a gentle movement that gradually increases in intensity, perfect for rebuilding strength without causing strain.</span>
</h3>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b data-mce-fragment="1">Shoulder Raises</b><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">: A simple yet effective exercise that helps in enhancing shoulder stability. It involves raising your arm slowly, holding for a few seconds, and then lowering it. Repetitive, yes, but highly effective.</span>
</h3>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b data-mce-fragment="1">External Rotations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">: This exercise targets the external rotators of the shoulder. It’s done with the help of a resistance band provided with the Shoulder Reliever, ensuring controlled and effective movement.</span>
</h3>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b data-mce-fragment="1">Scapular Squeezes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">: These focus on strengthening the muscles around the scapula, which play a vital role in shoulder stability. It’s a subtle exercise but works wonders over time.</span>
</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;" data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Nighttime Support</b></span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">At night, the Shoulder Reliever provides support that ensures your shoulder remains in a comfortable position, reducing strain and promoting healing while you sleep.</span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;"> The idea is to increase the blood flow to the affected area.  </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">This continuous support is a game changer, as it allows for uninterrupted recovery.</span></h3>
<h1 style="text-align: center;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><b data-mce-fragment="1">The Road to Recovery</b></h1>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Using the Shoulder Reliever, my shoulder continued to improve. The pain became manageable, then negligible. My range of motion returned, and with it, my confidence. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">I was able to teach my students without wincing in pain. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">My swing, once a source of frustration and despair, became fluid and powerful again.</span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">But it wasn’t just about physical recovery. The Shoulder Reliever gave me back a part of my identity that I feared I had lost forever. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">As a golf instructor, my ability to demonstrate techniques and correct my students' form is crucial. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Shoulder Reliever allowed me to do my job effectively and without pain.</span></h3>
<br data-mce-fragment="1">
<h1 style="text-align: center;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><b data-mce-fragment="1">Conclusion</b></h1>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The Shoulder Reliever was a game changer for me, and I’m not just saying that because it sounds good. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">It genuinely turned my life around If you’re dealing with shoulder pain, whether it’s from golf or any other activity, I highly recommend giving the Shoulder Reliever a try. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">I was skeptical, too, but sometimes, the solution we need comes from the most unexpected places. Don’t let pain hold you back. </span></h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-fragment="1" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Swing for the fences—well, in our case, the fairways—and give yourself the chance to get back in the game.<br><br><strong></strong></span></h3>

<h3>People speak of the rotator cuff like it is a deep monster of the shoulder and when it rears its ugly head it needs to be beaten back with a surgeon's knife.  </h3>
<h3>The rotator cuff starts as 4 muscles attached to various parts of the shoulder blade.  </h3>
<h3>Like all muscles they transition to tendons before they attach to the bone.  </h3>
<h3>The 4 tendons of the rotator cuff cap the top of the humerus.  The job of the rotator cuff is to keep the ball of the humerus sitting on the very shallow joint it occupies.  </h3>
<h3>The shallowness of the joint allows it to have the remarkable range of motion it enjoys.  This joint moves our hands all over.  270 degree range of motion.  </h3>
<h3>So much of my time I spend talking to people about tears in their rotator cuff.  </h3>
<h3><strong>Not all tears require surgery.<span> </span></strong></h3>
<h3>In fact, the vast majority of tears to not require surgery.  </h3>
<h3>If you have a few nicks in the rotator cuff you can still rehab, strengthen and get rid of pain.</h3>
<h3>Again the rotator cuff is still<span> </span><strong>4</strong> muscles.  </h3>
<h3>The other muscles can make up a bit for damage to one.  </h3>
<h3>Additionally, just because there is a partial tear does not mean the muscle is shot.  </h3>
<h3>Have you ever had a tear in your hamstring?  It still worked and you were able to get it back to a high level of functioning.</h3>
<h3>Remember 60% of 60 year olds have a tear in the rotator cuff.</h3>
<h3>They do not need surgery and maybe you do not either.</h3>
<h3>Check out the ROTATOReliever 2.0 today, it might just be what you need. </h3>
<h3>Hope this helps.</h3>

      <![CDATA[<h3><strong>One thing about chronic pain that people don’t understand is how much energy it actually takes out of you. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>We need to battle chronic pain wherever we see it. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Shoulder pain is so common that older folks and older patients are starting to accept it as a simply a state of being, a normal process of aging.  This is simply not the case. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>When someone starts to give up some of their functionality and accepts chronic pain:</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>1)  It takes energy from them.  It causes misery. It diminishes their quality of life.  2). When you start to lose function in one area, we see that it then begins the process of overall decreasing mobility. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>If you have lost the use of your shoulder or lifting your shoulder up over your head, then that tends to decrease your lateral movement. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>It tends to decrease your head looking up as you would reach over your head.  These small losses add up quickly.  </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>I spend a lot of time talking with my patients about the aging process; what is normal, what is abnormal, what can be expected, and really chronic pain in one area of the body is not part of the aging process. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Sure there is going to be some stiffness in the morning. There are going to be a few arthritic joints that show up and need some special management and consideration, but those joints are going to be used. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Particularly in regard to the shoulder, I see people basically giving up. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>They have tried to rehabilitate it and the problems have come back. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>What my patients need is a system they can use in an ongoing way, particularly in regard to the shoulder. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Something that they can go back to without having to go to the doctor.  We know that rotator cuff disease pathology and inflammation tends to be a chronic process. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>People get frustrated going to the doctor for the same thing and they get frustrated going to physical therapy for the same thing, and that is another part of this current state of affairs where there are literally millions of people suffering with reduced shoulder function and increased shoulder pain because they have gotten sick of it. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>We needed a better solution.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>That's why I created the ROTATOReliever.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>ROTATOReliever is the Doctor-Created Proven Day &amp; Night Shoulder Pain Relief Solution.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>I have been working on this for a decade.  We've gotten the product to 5000 people who really loved it. </strong></h3>

<h3>So, first of all if you want a strong shoulder then you have to have a strong base.  The base of the shoulder is the rotator cuff.  I see so many athletes and nonathletes that have muscle imbalance of the shoulder.  </h3>
<h3>Their pecs, traps and deltoid are plenty strong, but they have lost balance.  The rotator cuff whose job it is to keep the ball of the arm bone situated in the joint is not strong enough to fulfill the mission. There it is, I said it.</h3>
<h3>That is why 40 million americans have shoulder pain.  </h3>
<div class="entry-content">
<h3 class="entry-body">I my opinion there are 2 ways to strengthen the shoulder.  Either jump rope with regularity about 10 minutes 4 times a week, or use my product called the Rotatoreliever 4 minutes a day everyday.  </h3>
<h3 class="entry-body">My product also has a nighttime component, but you only need that if you are already having shoulder pain. Telling most people to jump rope is like telling them to chew on glass.  </h3>
<h3 class="entry-body">They look at me like I am nuts.  OK, those people can just buy my product, no problem.   I have an admission to make.  For years I thought protein powders were bunk.  Just eat right and work out and you will do fine.  But alas, the research has finally convinced me that I have erred in my ways.  </h3>
<h3 class="entry-body">Protein powders are important, particularly for old guys like me.  At 43 I am not that good at building muscle.  My body needs as much help as it can get.   The old guys and girls are the ones that need protein powder the most.  </h3>
<h3 class="entry-body">Consider the following.  Skeletal muscle represents 50-75% of all body proteins and approximately 40% of total body weight.  In addition to sheer volume, muscle possesses numerous vital functions such as for generation, temperature regulation, energy metabolism, amino acid reserves, immune function. In addition, the loss of muscle mass with advancing age (sarcopenia) is quickly becoming recognized as a major health concern as it has been linked to increasing disability, loss of independence, and decreased life expectancy.   RESISTANCE EXERCISE AND THE REGULATION OF MUSCLE PROTEIN SYNTHESIS (mps). Resistance exercise stimulates and increase in the rate of muscle protein synthesis.  The increase in MPS  occurs within the first hour after exercise and can persist for 48 hours.  </h3>
<h3 class="entry-body">AEROBIC EXERCISE AND TEH REGULATION OF MUSCLE PROTEIN SYNTHESIS Acute aerobic exercise stimulates MPS in the the fasted and sed states, while chronic aerobic exercise siims to elicit an increase in MPS at rest. Aerobic exercise primarily increases the mitochondrial protein synthesis (making the muscles you have stronger and more efficient) instead of myofibrillar protein synthesis (muscle mass). </h3>
<h3 class="entry-body">AGING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING Muscle loss observed in aging seems related to not building muscle in response to resistance training like the younger.  ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS (EAA) AND THE REGULATION OF THE MPS Amino acids have been shown to stimulate a muscle protein anabolic respone.  </h3>
<h3 class="entry-body">The stimulation of MPS last 1-2 hours after EAA ingestion.  Of the EAA luecine has received considerable attention becouse of its ability to independently stimulate MPS.   AGING AND EAAS The devil is in the details.  MPS is stimulated in older adults after ingestion of leucine-enriched supplement (6.7 g of EAA, 41% leucine), but with EAA (6.7 g of EAA, 26% leucine) MPS was not stimulated.  In young people it did not matter.  So the older folks appear to need at least 41% leucine in their supplements.  Further, small meals of protein (113g of lean beef) stimulated MPS and large meals of protein (340g of lean beef) did not.  </h3>
<h3 class="entry-body">This suggests that saving your protein intake for one meal a day is not a good idea.   Also ingestion of 6 g of EAAon hour after resistance exercise dramtically increased MPS.  Some studies have shown that ingestion of 20g of protein after exercise results in similar stimulation of MPS. CONCLUSION Work out.  </h3>
<h3 class="entry-body">Eat protien or essential amino acid supplement (high in leucine) 1-2 hours before and 1 hour after resistance training.  </h3>
<h3 class="entry-body">HOPE THIS HELPS</h3>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">There is a frequent pattern of injury amongst those who suffer from rotator cuff inflammation.</h3>
<h3>The shoulder goes through a cycle of injury followed by healing and then the patient will have a certain period of pain-free time only to re-injure it.</h3>
<h3>Soon enough, the periods of pain-free times are less and the movements that cause pain are more and the threshold for re-injuring the rotator cuff lessens.</h3>
<h3>What is going on is that the rotator cuff will become injured as it impinges under the coracoacromial arch. The rotator cuff has a very sensitive area on its superior muscle called the supraspinatus.</h3>
<h3>The rotator cuff is made up of four different muscles.</h3>
<h3>90% of the injuries originate at the supraspinatus muscle. As a person goes through years of this cycling, the rotator cuff becomes scarred; becomes less flexible; it becomes more easily torn; it becomes less subtle.</h3>
<h3>In effect, this rotator cuff prematurely ages and in this cycle of injury, inflammation, healing, scar tissue, the rotator cuff at some point becomes torn.</h3>
<h3>The key to treatment is to break that cycle of repeated injury to allow the rotator cuff to restore some of its flexibility to reduce some of its scar tissue. (This is where ROTATOReliever 2.0 works so well).</h3>
<h3>Constant re-injury needs to be avoided at all costs.</h3>
<h3>It delays the healing process and contributes to scare tissue and overall decreases the range of motion.</h3>
<h3>If you have a shoulder injury, it is critical to heal it quickly and completely.</h3>]]>

      <![CDATA[<h2><b>Physician and Shoulder Expert Shares Ten Tips for Alleviating Shoulder Pain</b></h2>
<p><b> </b></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Michael Carroll, M.D.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer is fast approaching.  We all have our visions of glory for our favorite season.  The winter coat of adipose, that thin layer of fattiness so many of us accumulate over the colder months, will no doubt be gone by the time of the fireworks finale.  The golf clubs will be relieved of insulting dust and will be propelling long hooks with authority. My college kids will be reminded that dad can still be a force to be reckoned with on the tennis court. </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now if I can just avoid the pitfalls of last summer.  </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The balky overhand serve and adventures on the golf course never came into line last year due to some progressive shoulder pain.  It was sadly ironic too – like something I’d worked with so many of my patients on – and now was suffering from myself. Shoulder pain can be so frustrating because it’s inconsistent in intensity and often difficult to pinpoint.  And it’s a summer-ruiner, to be certain – meaning less and less of the outdoor activities I love so much – and more and more of the sleepless, uncomfortable nights, caused by sharp, darting aches and pains radiating from the shoulder area.    Well-intentioned colleagues suggested surgery, but I didn’t want to have to deal with the recovery time if there was any possible way to avoid it.  </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spent the winter practicing the various shoulder strengthening and sparing elements of advice that I have so often preached to my patients, and it gave me a whole new perspective (physician, heal thyself, indeed).  My efforts have put my shoulder in fine working form in time for summer, no surgery required. My spring break weeklong, shoulder-testing foray into all things athletic was pain-free and my tennis serve had a lot of zip.  I am currently enjoying a distinct lack of what plagues 40 million Americans: shoulder pain. Here’s my 10-point program of tips and suggestions that anyone can practice in their own home to help alleviate shoulder pain.</span></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b>Strong foundation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  It turns out there are really 2 layers of muscles to the shoulder.  We know the names of the top layer: pectoralis, deltoid, and trapezius.  Many do not know the name of the most important layer: the rotator cuff.  The rotator cuff is actually 4 muscles that can be strengthened. A strong rotator cuff will keep the shoulder pain free and ready to roll.  So the first step is understanding this very basic anatomy of how our shoulders are constructed. </span>
</h3>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b>Add more strength</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  A shoulder with a strong foundation is ready for building strength.  Go ahead and do an overhead press with the 20-pound dumbbells -- it won’t hurt.  The strength helps the tennis serve, going for that par 5 in two shots, and yes -- getting the heavy sugar bag from the top shelf. It’s amazing how just a little shoulder-benefitting exercise like this can go a long way to helping and healing your shoulder. </span>
</h3>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b>Sleep right.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  I will spare you an anatomy lesson, but please know that one of the most important things you can do to help get rid of the pain long-term is to not sleep on the side of your bad shoulder.  Also, do not put your arm above your head when you sleep. Both of these positions cut off blood supply to really important parts of the rotator cuff that can rebuild while you sleep, as long as they are not being aggravated. </span>
</h3>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b>Protein powder works?? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I hate being wrong, particularly when the error rests on the mantle of stereotype.  What can I say? I thought protein powders were for meatheads pumping stacks of iron at the gym.  Alas, good “protein powder” products can actually really can help your muscles get stronger, provided you are actually doing some sort of exercise that puts the excess protein to good use.  Old guys may “rule,” but we also lose 8% of our muscle mass every decade starting age 30. The truth of the matter is that successful aging requires keeping muscle. So when I look for a good protein or “essential amino acid” product, I look for the one with the highest content of leucine.  Of all the building blocks of muscle in the powders, evidence suggests this is the most important. Taking a modest amount of protein powder and doing some good exercise (as in #2 above or #5 below) is a recipe for success in beating away that shoulder pain.</span>
</h3>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b>Jump rope.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  As noted in tip #1 above a strong foundation is the best place to start when combating shoulder pain.  The cheapest, easiest, fastest way to build a great foundation of the shoulder is the simple act of jumping rope.  I am not sure why so many of my patients look at me as if I have told them to eat glass when I advise them to jump rope.  You don’t have to do it like a world-class boxer or professional athlete – whatever speed and duration suits your fitness level is likely fine.  The motions your shoulder undergoes during a session of jumping rope are anatomically ideal for building and exercising the muscles that will protect you from shoulder pain. </span>
</h3>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b>Occasional use of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Not a long term solution, but until you get better, it’s OK to use this stuff on occasion when you’re hurting.  </span>
</h3>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b>Treat pain early.  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing I can tell you about the shoulder that applies to anyone at pretty much any stage of shoulder pain -- if you ignore the pain, it will not go away.  You need to do something, hence the list of tips in this article. The longer you try to “man up” and live through the pain, the worse it will get.</span>
</h3>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b>Use your head – not your shoulder!  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the time you are working to strengthen your shoulder as a routine, you need to take it easy when it comes to routine actions that could compromise your progress and lead to pain-related setbacks.  For example, do not reach into the back seat of the car to get a coffee cup off the floor. Seriously, don’t. Take a moment to get out of the care, walk around to the car door closest to the offending coffee cup, and get it that way.  The brief and temporary burden of “walking around” will save you from the far more burdensome experience of added shoulder pain later that night and for several nights to come. Similarly, do not take up chainsawing down branches from a recent storm.  Hey, there are a few concessions we must make to age.  </span>
</h3>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b>Ice really works.  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the really smart athletes – or the athletes with really smart trainers – that ice their joints after they work out -- even if those joints do not hurt.  Yes, if you want to change the bad things going on in a joint, or prevent bad things from happening there at all, cool the joint down! So, if smart young athletes are icing joints that don’t even hurt, you can take a few minutes to ice the shoulder that actually does hurt!</span>
</h3>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3>
<b>Use healing tools that really work.  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I actually helped design a simple, inexpensive system that helped some of my patients as well as myself.  It’s called the Rotatoreliever and is available online. It’s a kit that utilizes many of the pearls of wisdom above – providing some basic exercise techniques that specifically build the muscle foundation of the shoulder and helps the user create positions for sleep that help with the shoulder pain, etc.  Coupled with a jump rope, a few weights, and some common sense, it can be a great ingredient to a recipe for success getting rid of that infernal shoulder pain.</span>
</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have read this far into the article, I will not wish you your best summer -- as that was likely a few decades ago.  I like to think that there are, however, some potential “top ten” summers still out there. Take care of that shoulder and go have yourself one! </span></h3>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he began practicing he had something in common with his patients: shoulder pain.  </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical therapy and steroid injections into the shoulder did not work. This approach was not working for his patients either.  Dr. Carroll did something about it. He invented the ROTATOReliever.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ROTATOReliever is a revolutionary approach to shoulder pain.  The product treats the shoulder during the day and at night. Dr. Carroll understands that shoulder position at night is the key to reversing the process that is destroying millions of shoulders the world over.  </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The body wants to heal itself at night, and the ROTATOReliever allows that. As patients stop the nighttime injury, they are ready to pursue the key to a lifetime free of shoulder pain: getting the foundation of the shoulder stronger.  This is done with a simple, daily 4-minute exercise program.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ROTATOReliever has provided thousands with shoulder pain relief.  There is no risk to trying, as there is a 40-day money-back guarantee.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ROTATOReliever is a 40-day, 40-night treatment plan. If you are not better in 40 days, send the product back for a full refund.</span></h3>
